# DS2000-Project-2-Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-and-Visualisation
Course work of "DS2000 Programming with Data" that builds a single-index model for stocks price changes to evaluate the stocks' risk.

# Background and Motivation
I would like to build a single-index model for stocks price changes to evaluate the stocks' risk. The financial concept "high risk high return" means that the investors will be compensated for bearing high risk by higher return. However, some risks are firm specific risk that can be eliminated through portfolio diversification. Investors will only be compensated for the risk they bear that can not be eliminated by diversification, which is the systematic risk(also called market risk).
Basically, the project is running a regression of the return of stocks against the market return(approximated by S&P500) to find the correlation coefficient of a certain stock's return and the market changes. The correlation coefficient represents the systematic risk of the stock. By generating graphs of regression, one can judge the market risk from the slopes.
